"The Night Owl" project is a video game, it's a 2D platformer, which means the game is base on multiple layers of 2D (backgrounds, characters, etc..) and as old games like 'Mario Bros', you advance in the game by walking, jumping, dashing, and some others capacities, through the game, but only horizontally and vertically (2D).  

## Story :

You will embody a character called Billy (or something else), he is a young boy living with his parents in a comfortable house near the University of Rennes 1. A night, he deeply falls asleep and start dreaming, the gameplay begin at this moment, all the levels in the game take place in his dreams. You will have to fight monsters, cross obstacles, and finish all levels to be able to wake up and go to school tomorrow.

## Gameplay :

We choosed this scenario because, we wanted that each member of the group development could create his own level design, the dream context provide us a total freedom on the map and the capacities of the character. On every levels, he can walk, run, jump, roll, hook, fight with multiples weapons and also take damages and die.

We are in 2022, at the ISTIC on the campus of Beaulieu Rennes 1, and this project is our last final project to conlude the licence.
