"The Night Owl" project is a video game, it's a 2D platformer, which means the game is base on multiple layers of 2D (backgrounds, characters, etc..) and as old games like 'Mario Bros', you advance in the game by walking, jumping, dashing, and some others capacities, through the game, but only horizontally and vertically (2D).  

The plot of the game : 

You will embody a character called Billy (or something else), he is a young boy living with his parents in a comfortable house near the University of Rennes 1. A night, he deeply falls asleep and start dreaming, the gameplay begin at this moment, all the levels in the game take place in his dreams. You will have to fight monsters, cross obstacles, and finish all levels to be able to wake up and go to school tomorrow.

We choosed this scenario because, we wanted that each member of the group development could create his own level design, the dream context provide us a total freedom on the map and the capacities of the character. So on every levels, he can walk, run, jump, dash, hook, fight with multiples weapons and also take damages and die.


The technology used to make this game is the graphics engine called 'Unity', on the version 2021.3.3f1, the members of the group are :

Jacques Le Guevel, Sergio XXX, Nolwenn XXX, Cecilia XXX and myself Antoine Quere.

We are in 2022, at the ISTIC on the campus of Beaulieu Rennes 1, and this project is our last final project to conlude the licence. We choosed the 2D platformer type due to the timeline (6 weeks), we tought that we needed simples graphics and easy gameplay to be able to deliver a full game clean and fun. We hope that you will enjoy our creation, thank you, cordially,


Team Night Owl.
